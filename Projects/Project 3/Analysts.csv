Do you enjoy diving into data and finding patterns? Are you interesting in learning what drives sales for any ecommerce business, using advanced digital data analysis techniques?

Insight and Results â€“ We will teach you how to analyze data, and explain patterns/insights to clients â€“ you will learn how to explain and influence using logic and data. We aim to help clients reallocate time and money from business activities that donâ€™t work, to marketing tactics that deliver value to the brand.
Communication â€“ Finally, and critically, you will be exposed to regular communications with clients; eventually helping manage client calls on both Google Analytics/Google Tag Manager and Media/DoubleClick Engagements. Listening and understanding each clientâ€™s individual needs, requirements and expectations is something that you are going to learn over time.
Also, overtime:
â€“ Project Management â€“ You will be trained to project manage the activities and tasks in-between client calls.
â€“ Strategic Planning â€“ Preparing monthly and quarterly presentations to synthesize what has been completed to date and provide plans through the next quarter.
â€“ Account Management â€“ Working with leadership to track budgets and investments for each client and project. Provide forecasts for future needs and educate and explain to clients new ideas to grow their business.

Program Overview
Over the last decade, more countries, cities, and communities have sought to protect economic growth and reduce extreme poverty by better managing the impacts of climate change. With the signing of the Paris Agreement, 192 governments agreed to a global goal on adaptation. Current mitigation commitments have reduced the trajectory of emissions to give us a chance to keep global temperature increase to 2.7 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Risks associated with this temperature scenario could threaten our ability to reduce poverty, develop sustainably and achieve well-being and security for all. The decisions we make today could lead us toward a more climate resilient future, or they could undermine food, water and energy security for decades to come.
A new high-level Global Commission on Adaptation, led by former UN Secretary General Ban Ki Moon, will launched in October 2018. It will be composed of current and former heads of government and leaders from business, philanthropy and civil society. The Commission seeks to elevate the political visibility of adaptation with a strong focus on solutions. The Commission will develop a narrative that marks a qualitative shift in the way we think about and act on adaptation. It will demonstrate that adapting to climate change improves human well-being and results in better, more sustainable economic development and security for all. It will make the case for the importance of taking climate risks into account and radically changing the way we do development. And most importantly of all, it will show the importance of ensuring that adaptation action and support reaches the most vulnerable.
Following its formal launch in October 2018, the Commission will engage in outreach and coalition building within the wider development and adaptation communities. It will also prepare and deliver a Flagship Report at the UN Climate Summit in September 2019. This outreach, coalition building, and report will catalyze a year of action during which Commissioners and partners will inspire governments, multilateral organizations, the private sector and civil society to enhance adaptation commitments, mobilize finance and accelerate action.
The Commission Secretariat will be co-hosted by the Global Center on Adaptation and the World Resources Institute.
Secretariat of the Global Commission on Adaptation Overview
The Secretariat of the Global Commission on Adaptation will be co-hosted by the Global Center on Adaptation in the Netherlands and the World Resources Institute in Washington, DC. Secretariat staff will be responsible for developing and coordinating the Commission work program and for delivering the report and other analytical products. The Secretariat will coordinate and support the engagement and communications activities of the Commissioners. It will also manage the Commission budget and donor reporting and implement fundraising and communications strategies.
Global Center on Adaptation
The Global Center on Adaptation was initiated by UN Environment and the governments of the Netherlands, Japan and the Philippines and has established partnerships with global organizations, NGOs, governments, financial institutions, knowledge institutions and businesses to accelerate climate adaptation. The Center focuses its activities on those areas where acceleration is most needed: where action is most urgently required and where this is complementary to the work of others. It is an independent organization, working across the Global North and South, headquartered in the Netherlands.
The Center works across different sectors and cross-cutting issues to define and scale up effective climate adaptation. It does this by mobilizing and convening the global adaptation community through discussion briefs, workshops, webinars &amp; conferences to set the global adaptation knowledge agenda. The Center recognizes and builds excellence by identifying projects for best practices and lessons learned to share tools, guidance, metrics and lessons.

The outlet surveys will collect information about family planning commodity and service delivery availability, price, and market share and the household surveys will collect information from the consumer on family planning use, access, and perception of the supply market to explore local supply and demand interaction. The approach to collecting data from all outlets in the project areas (via a census-based approach) will also be compared to the approaches employed by other large-scale surveys such as PMA2020 and the DHS.

PSI seeks a Research and Program Analyst for the CM4FP research project.

The Healthcare Analytics &amp; Delivery team uses healthcare data (payer / provider / 3rd party data) and analytics to answer some of the most pressing questions our healthcare clients have today such as â€œHow do we manage cost of care while improving quality?â€, â€œHow do we remain competitive in the evolving healthcare landscape?â€, â€œWho are the most vulnerable patients and what interventions can we design to better care for them?â€.

Our capabilities are foundational to multiple high profile initiatives and have been core to the Healthcare practice in delivering organization wide transformation programs for payors (public and private) or providers. The team has grown to 200+ colleagues globally over the last 4 years. It is a unique mix of Healthcare Experts, physicians, statisticians, engineers, data scientists, and more.

Youâ€™ll have the opportunity to develop an expertise on at least one Healthcare Analytics asset (e.g., a specific model or a specific episode of care).

Additionally, youâ€™ll develop a strong knowledge base related to healthcare payment innovation (e.g., Episode-based payment models, PCMH, ACO, Health Homes, Capitation models) and of claims data (e.g., ICD-9 codes, CPT codes, pharmacy claims coding). You will be involved in working with multiple clients and assets at the same time, and may be responsible for managing a project autonomously.

The Strategy Analytics team (within Strategy &amp; Innovation) leverages the power of data and analytics to shape strategic decisions at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. We were awarded the 2012 INFORMS Prize for â€œrepeatedly applying the principles of advanced analytics and operations research / management science in pioneering, varied, novel, and lasting ways.â€ Our team cares deeply about solving meaningful problems that will measurably impact the lives of MSKâ€™s patients and staff.

We are seeking a Data Scientist / Senior Strategic Analyst (Communications &amp; Marketing) who will serve as a champion for data-driven decision making within Communications, particularly for programs to strengthen MSKâ€™s relationships with physicians and partners in the tri-state area, across the US, and internationally.

Embedded Analytics Program

This position is part of our Embedded Analytics Program, wherein Strategy &amp; Innovation analysts are embedded in operational departments and immersed in their challenges. This position has dual reporting to (1) the SVP/Chief Communications Officer for goals setting and project implementation and (2) the Analytics Manager for technical supervision and mentorship. Embedded Analytics allows for the best of both worlds: being a full member of an operational team to truly understand their needs and ensure sustainable implementation of work, while still being part of a diverse and energizing community of analytics experts. We support technical and business skill development in a variety of ways, including conferences and external workshops, internal training and journal clubs, creating analytical tools and best practices, and developing our own in-house R package.

Department of Communications &amp; Marketing

As a leader in cancer treatment and research for more than 130 years, MSK sets an equally high standard for the effectiveness of our communications and marketing efforts. Our focus is on generating demand for MSK services and active consideration of MSK as the best place for cancer treatment, research, and education. The team encompasses public relations, social media, web content, digital tools, consumer marketing and advertising, business-to-business communications, and research insights.

You will:
Serve as an analytical thought partner to Communications leadership, especially the Senior VP, Director of Business/Physician Relations, Director of CRM, and Director of Digital Communications
Become deeply versed in the operational needs of Communications and own the strategic roadmap for iteratively developing analytical products in support of those needs
Independently manage individual analytical products and projects from â€œquestion to answerâ€ including problem framing, data collection and validation, exploratory analysis, statistical modeling, visualization, and synthesis
Effectively communicate actionable insights and see them through to implementation
Sample projects include:

Developing a global data model of the network of international physicians (leveraging our past success with a data model for US-based physicians) from disparate and often conflicting sources
Analyzing the relative impact of business-to-business programs (e.g. continuing medical education, newsletters, observership programs) on referrals and patient volumes
Leveraging patient behavioral and outcomes data to continually improve our digital engagement platform for prospective patients
Collaborating with the customer relationship management (CRM) team to set up our analytical environment within Salesforce and develop segmentation and targeting strategies
Qualifications:

We are looking for an analytics professional who has both deep technical skills and a passion for applying them to real-world problems in partnership with non-technical stakeholders. Our successful analysts typically have the below qualifications:
A proven track record (4+ years of experience) of using analytics and data science to impact key business decisions.
Youâ€™ve built reproducible analyses using R, Python, or a similar language
Youâ€™re deeply comfortable with relational databases and SQL
You know how to choose the right technical approach for a question (from a statistical model to a dashboard and everything in between) and know that the simplest solution is often the best
Youâ€™re a storyteller, able to synthesize knowledge from a variety of sources and clearly communicate complex topics to non-technical audiences
Youâ€™re curious and self-motivated, and you thrive when working autonomously. You know when to run with something and when to ask for help.
You have a solid understanding of common statistical methods (especially regression and probability)
You have a bachelorâ€™s degree in a quantitative field (statistics, economics, operations research, mathematics, etc.) or equivalent training, fellowship, or work experience

We envision a just society in which the use and regulation of drugs are grounded in science, compassion, health, and human rights; in which people are no longer punished for what they put into their own bodies but only for crimes against others; and in which the fears, prejudices, and punitive prohibitions of today are no more. Our mission is to advance those policies and attitudes that best reduce the harms of both drug misuse and drug prohibition, and to promote the sovereignty of individuals over their minds and bodies.

The Researcher and Quantitative Analyst will join our passionate, diverse, and creative team at a critical time for the drug policy reform movement in the United States. U.S. leaders are now doubling down on the war on drugs, using it as a tool to stoke fear in society and rally their base, and as an excuse to lock up or deport people of color and immigrants. Tens of thousands of people are dying from opioid overdoses, with little meaningful response by the federal government. At the same time, we are seeing state and local governments taking action, increasingly legalizing marijuana, passing Good Samaritan laws, and even exploring safe consumption sites. Public opinion, too, is increasingly in our favor, with ever larger numbers of people supporting alternatives to current policies of prohibition and criminalization. In this context, DPAâ€™s expertise on drug policy, rigorous analysis, and strong, principled voice stand to make an enormous difference in shaping public opinion and policy, and ultimately making a concrete difference to the lives of millions in the U.S. and beyond.

Over the last 15 years, DPA has expanded from its New York headquarters to a total of eight offices, close to 80 staff, an annual operating budget of approximately $17 million, 25,000 dues-paying members and more than 300,000 online subscribers. It has a solid track record of success at the local, state, and federal levels and consistent visibility in prominent media and policy circles.
